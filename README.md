- hey it's me. i am out here trying to stay frosty in the heat of the metaverse.
- click <a href ='https://albertlarson.github.io'>here</a> for my 'proper' splash page.<br><br>
- i had my own secure site propped up, but it didn't generate that much interest. 
- fwiw, i built it with uwgsi, nginx, certbot, and flask and was pushing traffic through my public ip to a port, like you do...
- if i was going to do it again, i'd probably build with django. nice admin interface, db hooks, ...<br><br>
- if i'm writing code i mostly spend my time on backend scientific computing, but i also like frontend design.
- generally speaking, i write use python language predominantly with jupyter notebooks. 
- my focus is creating imagery and that flow works for prototyping.<br><br>
- if i was going to compile, i'd probably use julia, go, fortran, c, c++, rust, or lua.
- i started 'programming' building web pages. <a href = 'http://www.funkychickens.com/main.asp'>funky chickens</a> anyone?
