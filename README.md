- generally speaking, i write using python in a virtual jupyter environment, managed with pip (and if i have to, miniconda). 
- my broad creative computing interest is creating helpful imagery from data.<br><br>
- i started 'programming' building web pages. <a href = 'http://www.funkychickens.com/main.asp'>funky chickens</a> anyone?
