- hey it's me 👋🏻. i'm out here tryin' t' stay frosty in the heat o' the metaverse.
- click <a href ='https://albertlarson.github.io'>here</a> for my 'proper' splash page.<br><br>
- if i'm writing code i mostly spend my time on backend scientific computing, but i also like frontend design.
- generally speaking, i write using python in a virtual jupyter environment, managed with pip (and if i have to, miniconda). 
- my focus is creating imagery and that flow works for prototyping.<br><br>
- if i was going to compile, i'd probably use julia, go, fortran, c, c++, rust, or lua.
- i started 'programming' building web pages. <a href = 'http://www.funkychickens.com/main.asp'>funky chickens</a> anyone?
- i'm usually available via email or text message! i don't get a lot of messages, don't be afraid. but maybe be nice?
- that's all for now! thanks for reading
